# Gopher Cache
This is a small in-memory database. It was built with the intention to mock a Redis database, so that it behaves in a similar way as the real one from the user/client perspective.
The source code of the project is fully written in Go. The initial goal of this project was to build a mini copy of the Redis database in order to increase understanding of both
the Redis internals and the Go programming language. However, everybody is welcome to check the code, propose improvements, create their own forks/versions, and use the source code
for their own purposes.
